>New Metropole, 200 years post Rupture. Thanks to the Gendermerie's vigilance and the Inquisition's blood magic, Metropolitans enjoy comfortable lives safe from attack by Dead Ghasts or infection from Acute Synthesis Disintegration Disease. Meanwhile, the Crusade marches outwards, further extending the reach of The Consulate and bringing ever more peoples under its watchful care. To some, humanity seems in the midst of a Utopian age. The Rupture may even be more a blessing than a curse, a gift from the Entity whose voice whispers from its depths. But for this gift, what is expected in return?

 This is a collection of six stories. The tales of six women — two sets of triplets, one by blood, one by circumstance — and the ways in which one lone girl has shaped their lives. It's natural to start most stories at their beginnings. But, for these, it’s more fitting to embark from their end.
